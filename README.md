The goal of the project is that our client Perstorp Holding AB proposed for a solution of their Transport Enquiry process. 
A single Transport Enquiry form needs to be presented to end customer which will have some required details like Transport Equipment, type of Goods, Loading details (like Place, Maximum quantity), Destination port, Delivery Terms, email address and few other fields as well. 
Customer will submit the form and a confirmation email will be sent with Transport Enquiry details as text in email body and excel attachment.
